Version 0.1 - S.S. Failboat
------
N/A

Version 0.2 - Suicide Notepad
------
-Added functions for repetitive codeblocks
-Replaced a big ugly block of sed/awk/sorting with sort keys for the date-listing option
-Added functions for formatting options with vim and nano editors
  +Vim will now open on the line directly below the entry header, in INSERT  mode, with linebreaks at 70 chars
  +Nano will now open on the line directly below the entry header
-Added comment labels for sections
-Added check for the default $EDITOR variables
-Added check for nano
-Added check for password file when entry directory exists
-Added check for unencrypted files
-Added 50% more sass mouth.
  +You will wonder why you got that rather than the sandwich you asked for.
-Nano is now the default editor, so as not to spook newbs.

Version 0.3 - Prettiest Pony
------
-Added password checking, which will exit with an error message if password is incorrect
-Added checks for a missing passwordfile, or if the file is unencrypted, and forces entry of a new one for better security.
  +If unencrypted, the file is deleted and the previous password is established by checking the encryption key on a previous entry.
-Edit-checking through md5sum: looks at the hash before and after a file is opened, and spits out a message which varies on whether edits were made or not.
-Code cleanup.
-Single keypress enters the choice for header entry.
-Header changed for standouttiness.
-The listing option now uses the bash builtin "select."
-Traps CTRL+C during interaction points, and reencrypts the file before quitting.
-If vimeditor is set, a custom syntax file is written and used for header highlighting.

Version 0.4 - Cyberpunky Brewster
------
-If nanoeditor is set, syntax options are written to ~/.nanorc and used for header highlighting.
-Lockfile is written to prevent multiple instances. Removed with EXIT trap.
-Vim syntax changed to only highlight the header lines.
-Cleaned up the entry searching.
  +No longer decrypts/reencrypts the files--uses ccat
  +Pipes the results to less for scrolling and easier searching
-Added a deletion option
-Added interactive mode
  +Password only has to be entered once during the session
  +Supports all command line options
  +Password is kept as a plaintext variable, so it is probably wicked unsecure

Version 0.4.5 (security updates, bug fixes)
-----
-Added umask and chmod for making entries readable only by then user
-Fixed a couple variable bugs which affected interactive mode
-Fixed the brainfart detection for interactive mode
-The saved-post sass-mouth is now randomly generated

Version 0.5 - Wooshless Wonder
-----
-Fixed the day-change bug. Now Bournal re-reads the FILE variable if
interactive mode is left open over multiple days, causing a new file to be
created on the current day.
-Fixed password bug in i-mode. Non-matching passwords would drop you out of
i-mode.
-Moved the varying variables (EDITOR, DIRECTORY) to an RC file. More options
may be added later. This helps options remain static between Bournal versions.
-Added date-sorting to the listing option, e.g. bournal -l Aug 2008
-Fixed the entry-listing bug for when a non-listed number or string is entered.
-Fixed ~/.nanorc highlighting for thursdays, saturdays and sundays
-Minor code cleanup

Version 0.6 - Deprecated Drama Queen
-----
-Fixed a bug in the lister's year filter
-Changed over to one-file-per-entry system
  +Only one entry is now visible at once, meaning a cleaner entry interface
  +Each file has the post-time appended to the filename
  +Running Bournal without an argument no longer asks whether to make a new subject; all previous entry editing is now done through the -ls/ls commands
  +The listing and deletion functions are now two-fold: First select a day, then a subject to edit or delete
-Added a migration script to make old posts conform to the new system.

-Rewrote the listing and deletion functions so that they supports selecting entries with identical subject lines or no subject lines.
-Enhanced the findy section in interactive mode for more accurate argument handling.
-Cleaned up the code in various places.
-Added tab-completion to interactive mode.
-Added a month argument to the searchy function for per-month searches. Yay, faster searches!
-Fixed a listy bug which caused days to be shown multiple times when both the month and year arguments were given.

Version 0.9 - Melodramatic Memoirs
----
-Vim swp files that are left after an unexpected quit no longer trigger the re-encryption function.
-Fixed vim syntax highlighting. Was looking at me funny. I FIXED IT GOOD.
-Fixed a typo that caused "oct" to be read as an invalid month when listing.
-Both the "-ls" and "-l" flags work, for better intuitiveness.
-Added an "-lst" flag, which only lists entries made today.

Version 1.1 - Tear-stained Terminal
----
-Moved the --help, --version, and --hack_the_planet conditions above the
lockfile creator so they can be used while another bournal instance is
running.
-Rewrote the search code in interactive mode, because it was doing god knows
what.
-Searches no longer include the date line, so a search for "sep" will come up
with "sepsis" or "septum," but not all entries made in September.

Version 1.2 - Gloomy GNU
----
